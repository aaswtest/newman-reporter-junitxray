# newman-reporter-junitxray
A Newman Junit reporter designed simplify output for use with XRAY for JIRA
JUnit reporter for [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) that provides the information about the collection run in a JUnit format.
This needs to be used in [conjunction with Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman#external-reporters) so that it can recognize JUnit reporting options.

> JUnit Reporter so that the JUnit results XML can be used in Conjunction with XRay for JIRA and provide a 1:1 relationship of requests per test cases (Instead of assertions per rquest being reported as unique test cases.)

> Different from [newman-reporter-junit](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/blob/develop/lib/reporters/junit/index.js) is using executions to have full report and no aggregated report.
Please use [newman-reporter-junit](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/blob/develop/lib/reporters/junit/index.js) if you want the original aggregated results.

```console
$ npm install -g newman-reporter-junitxray
